### Discover Remote QA and Testing Jobs in the USA

This project aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date list of companies based in the United States that offer remote opportunities in software testing and quality assurance. As remote work becomes more prevalent across the tech industry, we recognize the need for a centralized resource that helps QA professionals find relevant job opportunities without the hassle of extensive research.

### Why This Resource Exists

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a community-driven resource that connects remote QA and testing professionals with companies actively hiring in this field. By maintaining an open-source list, we ensure that the information remains current, accurate, and relevant to the needs of the community. Contributions are welcomed from anyone who wants to help expand or refine the list, ensuring it remains a valuable resource for all.
